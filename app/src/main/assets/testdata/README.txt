Note: the DB API works only very rarely. I've downloaded some real data from the API and saved it here so the app can be demo'd despite the problems with the Deutsche Bahn API. The following scenario should be supported by this sample data:
* User loads departure board for N端rnber
* User clicks the first train in the list and can see details of that train
* User clicks the W端rzburg stop in the the train detail list
* User sees the W端rzburg departure board.
* User can click the first train on the W端rzburg departure board to see its details.
